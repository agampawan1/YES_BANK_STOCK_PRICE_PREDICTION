# YES_BANK_STOCK_PRICE_PREDICTION
Predict the closing price of yes bank stock using regression and time-series analysis.
The project titled "Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction" aims to analyze and predict the stock price of Yes Bank, a leading private sector bank. The project utilizes various regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Regression, to compare their effectiveness in forecasting the stock price.

The project starts by gathering historical stock price data of Yes Bank, along with relevant financial and market indicators. This dataset is then preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize the features for accurate modeling.

Initially, Linear Regression is applied to establish a baseline prediction model. This technique utilizes a linear equation to establish a relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (stock price). The model is trained using a portion of the dataset and evaluated on the remaining data to measure its accuracy.

Next, Lasso Regression is employed to identify and select the most relevant features that have a significant impact on the stock price prediction. Lasso Regression applies L1 regularization to the linear regression model, effectively shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. The performance of Lasso Regression is then compared to the baseline model.

Following Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression is implemented to address the potential issue of multicollinearity among the independent variables. Ridge Regression applies L2 regularization to the linear regression model, which adds a penalty term to the loss function, reducing the impact of multicollinearity. The accuracy of Ridge Regression is evaluated and compared with the previous models.

Lastly, Elastic Regression is utilized to incorporate both L1 and L2 regularization techniques. It provides a balance between feature selection (Lasso) and addressing multicollinearity (Ridge). By tuning the regularization hyperparameters, Elastic Regression attempts to achieve the optimal model performance.

Throughout the project, the accuracy of each regression technique is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared value. The model with the lowest MSE and RMSE, along with the highest R-squared value, is considered the most accurate in predicting the Yes Bank stock price.

The results and analysis obtained from comparing the various regression techniques will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of each method for stock price prediction. This project contributes to the field of machine learning by offering a comprehensive comparison of different regression algorithms in the context of financial forecasting, specifically for Yes Bank's stock price.
